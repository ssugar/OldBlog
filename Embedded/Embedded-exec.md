### Problem Statement
Your team has built some beautiful MS Power BI reports, and you'd like to share those with your clients and/or vendors, but the cost of licensing all of your clients with a Power BI Pro license is too high.  Or you have a few dedicated MS Power BI report authors that would like to share the reports they've built with the rest of your company, but again the cost of licensing every user with a Power BI Pro license

### Decision Points
