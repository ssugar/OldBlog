# 101 - What is Power BI for?
###### by [Scott Sugar](https://linkedin.com/in/scottsugar)

I recently spoke with a colleague that had completed a Power BI [Dashboard In A Day](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/diad/) course, and during their post-training research they ran into terms like [Data Warehouse](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/) and [Data Lake](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/data-lake/), and wondered how it all fit together.  The training course taught them how to build a dashboard in a day - connect into data, clean/transform it, visualize it, and publish it - all within Power BI.  So where did these other systems fit in?

From there, we discussed what I find are the two ways to leverage Power BI
1. A drag-and-drop reporting application that sits on top of other data systems
2. A full end-to-end data orchestration and analysis system

Within the first way, you would typically leverage some combination of: a [Data Orchestration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/introduction) tool, possibly a [Data Lake](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/data-lake/), then [dimensionally model](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/four-4-step-design-process/) your data for loading into a [Data Warehouse](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/), pre-analyze and load your data into an [in-memory table](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/analysis-services/), and potentially integrate other [AI/ML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/) systems - all in order to extract, clean, transform, and load your data such that Power BI simply sits on top providing you a nice way to create visualizations/reports, and most importantly Power BI Online provides a *secure* way to share your reports with other users in your organization that integrates easily with other O365 systems ([SharePoint](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/integrate-power-bi-reports-in-sharepoint-online/), [Teams](https://guyinacube.com/2020/03/03/integrate-power-bi-reports-in-microsoft-teams/)).  

As for the second way to leverage Power BI - a full end-to-end data analysis system. The [Dashboard In A Day](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/diad/) training sessions clearly show that Power BI is fully capable of connecting directly into hundreds of data sources, cleaning and modeling that data with [M/Power Query](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/power-query-what-is-power-query), creating complex relationships between data sources, and even integration of some basic [AI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-announces-new-ai-capabilities/) functionality - all within Power BI Desktop (which is free!).  Power BI Online then provides the *secure* way to share your reports with other users in your organization and schedule automatic refreshes of those reports.  So essentially, Power BI is capable of performing all the extracting, cleaning and logic that a [Data Orchestration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/introduction) plus [Data Warehouse](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/) system would normally be configured to do.

Despite being extremely capable, I find there are some short-comings of using Power BI as a full end-to-end data orchestration and analysis system.  The main issues are:
1. Scalability - copy/pasting logic between reports is ok with 5-10 reports, but becomes unmanageable when you get to dozens or hundreds of reports.
2. Consistency - different reports will be refreshed on different schedules, and may clean or transform data in a different ways potentially resulting in different numbers in different reports.  Another way to say this is that there is no single source of truth across reports.  When this occurs, faith in the BI program itself is diminished.  Award winning restaurants pride themselves on consistency for a reason.
3. Collaboration - Power BI files are currently [binary files](https://ideas.powerbi.com/forums/265200-power-bi-ideas/suggestions/36978934-built-in-git-support-in-powerbi-desktop) and don't play well with code management and collaboration systems like [git](https://git-scm.com/).  This means that two (or more) BI developers can't simultaneously work on the same Power BI report and then merge their respective changes into a single Power BI report file.  This also eliminates the possiblity of automated code review/test prior to releasing changes.

The above limitations are overcome by adding in a [Data Orchestration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/introduction) tool, and [dimensionally modeling](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/four-4-step-design-process/) your data for loading into a [Data Warehouse](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/) that acts as the single source of truth for the organization.

So how do I recommend leveraging Power BI?  My belief is that there is a hybrid approach that acknowledges the best practices laid out decades ago by [Kimball and Ross](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/books/data-warehouse-dw-toolkit/) built on the technologies laid out in Microsoft's [Modern Data Warehouse Architecture](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/solutions/architecture/modern-data-warehouse/) in order to build a robust BI/DW system, while also understanding that building and configuring those technologies takes time and money.  So a multi-stream approach which uses Power BI as a rapid exploration and initial version development tool and then productionizes the logic and analyses into [data pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities) which ultimately load [conformed dimension](https://www.kimballgroup.com/2011/06/design-tip-135-conformed-dimensions-as-the-foundation-for-agile-data-warehousing/) and [fact](https://www.kimballgroup.com/2008/11/fact-tables/) tables in a [Data Warehouse](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/).  This is aimed at both accelerating value to report consumers and iteratively building a robust single source of truth.
